# ExultAndroid
Ancient, unmaintained port of Exult to Java for Android.

Quoting Dominus on issue #2:

> This port to Android is very old by now and never even close to being finished. Probably a lot of things changed since then. You are more likely to succeed by adapting the native Android patch
> http://goo.gl/E2y7Z. Since that patch we changed a lot of stuff, most importantly we switched to SDL2 which is much more compatible with Android. Also the port to iOS is probably helpful as some kind of guidance what needs to be done to make it work
